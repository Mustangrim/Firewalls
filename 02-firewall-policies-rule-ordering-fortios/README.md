---

## Lab Scenario

### Business Context
Your organization uses FortiGate firewalls to protect internal and edge networks. The security team has identified several critical issues:

1. **Security Breach Risk:** Current firewall policies expose the network to external attackers and malicious insiders
2. **Policy Conflicts:** Some firewall rules are not functioning as intended due to ordering problems
3. **Overprivileged Access:** The accounting department has excessive network access to DMZ resources
4. **Incident Response Gap:** Current logging structure makes threat hunting and alert creation inefficient

### Technical Challenge
A network engineer created a rule to block a potentially compromised workstation (`desktop-accounting-45`), but the device can still access restricted resources. This indicates a fundamental rule ordering problem that must be resolved.

---

## Theoretical Foundation

### FortiGate Rule Processing Logic

**Sequential Evaluation:**
- FortiGate processes policies from **top to bottom**
- **First match wins** - no additional rule evaluation occurs
- Incorrect ordering can cause security bypass or service disruption

**Common Ordering Mistakes:**
```
❌ WRONG ORDER:
1. ALLOW All_Accounting → DMZ (broad rule)
2. DENY desktop-accounting-45 → DMZ (specific rule - never reached)

✅ CORRECT ORDER:  
1. DENY desktop-accounting-45 → DMZ (specific deny first)
2. ALLOW All_Accounting → DMZ (broad allow after exceptions)
```

### Security Architecture Principles

**Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant minimum required access for business functions
**Defense in Depth:** Multiple layers of granular controls
**Explicit Deny:** Block unauthorized traffic with dedicated rules for better logging
**Exception-Based Design:** Handle special cases before general rules

## Knowledge Check: Rule Ordering Scenarios

### Question 1: IP-Specific Blocking
**Scenario:** You have a policy allowing all internet IPs to access HTTP/HTTPS of your company website. IP `179.178.29.9` is performing brute-force attacks and must be blocked.

**What rule should be added at the top?**

A) Block access from all on HTTP/HTTPS protocols  
B) Block access from only IP 179.178.29.9 on all protocols and ports  
C) Block access from only 179.178.29.9 on HTTP protocol  
D) Allow access from only 179.178.29.9 on HTTPS protocols

**✅ Correct Answer: B) Block access from only IP 179.178.29.9 on all protocols and ports**

**Rationale:** Blocking all protocols ensures the malicious IP cannot pivot to other attack vectors, while maintaining website availability for legitimate users.

### Question 2: Network Segmentation Exception
**Scenario:** Accounting network (10.0.3.0/24) is blocked from DMZ (10.0.1.0/24) on port 22. However, IP 10.0.3.30 needs SSH access to 10.0.1.10 for log transfers.

**What rule should be added at the top?**

A) Allow network 10.0.3.0/24 to access 10.0.1.0/24 on all ports  
B) Allow network 10.0.3.0/24 to access 10.0.1.0/24 on port 22  
C) Allow only IP 10.0.3.30 to access 10.0.1.10 on port 22  
D) Allow only IP 10.0.3.30 to access 10.0.1.0/24 on port 22

**✅ Correct Answer: C) Allow only IP 10.0.3.30 to access 10.0.1.10 on port 22**

**Rationale:** Most specific rule with exact source IP, destination IP, and required protocol minimizes attack surface.
